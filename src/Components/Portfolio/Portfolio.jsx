        "This C++ program was developed to calculate the average number of hours a student spent studying both math and programming on a daily basis. By prompting the user to input the total number of hours dedicated to each subject over a specified period, the program efficiently computed the daily average for both disciplines. Built using C++, it utilized simple input and output operations, along with basic arithmetic functions, to ensure accurate calculations. Its primary aim was to help students track and optimize their study schedules by providing a clear breakdown of how time was distributed between math and programming. The use of C++ ensured quick execution and a smooth user experience, making it a valuable tool for managing academic productivity.",
